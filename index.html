			<h3> Read what you want </h3>
			<p> Books are available for reading for our customers with no additional fees. 
			Just come in, order your favourite coffe and grab a book you always wanted to read! 
			Maybe there is one you would never be able to find in a local library? </p>
			<p>Our collection has quite wide range of titles and authors, it is certain 
			that anyone would find the perfect book among them. Classics, poetry, fantasy, sci-fi, 
			romance... we are not sure there is a type we don't own!</p>

			<h3> Not only books?</h3>
			<p> A gramophone is a perfect music player for a climatic place as Neat Café. 
			And it would be a huge mistake not to have one! Fortunately, ours family's attics 
			spared us some vinyls for everyone to enjoy. </p>
			<p> We have plenty of jazz, blues, classic and country vinyls. What makes them so special? 
			The vinyl record still has a physical value which we have to take care of, and because of this,
			the older the piece is, the more love and time it had to receive. And that is what we call a soul.
			Some people say that analog playback sounds better than digital music, which fills the space in every other place</p>

			<h3> Bring your books! </h3>
			<p> If you have any valuable books you don't want to keep, we can take care of them. 
			In exchange, you get a cup of coffee, or even more. Watch our promotions to find a promo suiting you the best.
			We try to announce a new one every other month so you can't miss it. </p>
			<p>Until now, with our exchange system we have collected over 500 books, which equals to almost as many coffees! 
			On one hand it is sad to give away books but on the other hand they might find someone who would love them even more tham before. And let it be our motto.</p>

		<div class="about-text">
			<p>We are a small cafe in a small city with huge amount of books to read. How did it started?
			At first we realised our private stach of books started to grow in a unpredictable pace. 
			And as a book lovers, we couldn't just let them go.</p>
			<p>The neverending pile of books was a huge problem to us. Thinking about how it would feel 
			like being buried alive in things we love, we decided it has to be resolved somehow.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div class="about-text">
			<p>One day we had an idea. Every time before we sat down to read, a cup of coffe must have been 
			prepared and ready to accompany our alternative world. Why not make a place where we would love 
			to spend our free time and make money out of it?</p>
			<p>And then everything started, finding a great venue and people, choosing the best menu and promoting 
			our business in local market. That's how we created Neat Café.</p>
